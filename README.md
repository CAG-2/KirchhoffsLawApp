# KirchhoffsLawApp
This is a web app which allows the user to create a circuit using cells and resistors and will calculate missing values using Kirchhoff's laws. This is my IB ITGS IA. The web app is completely static and does not require Node.JS or any similar framework to run - it can simply run in your browser.

Please note that this application is in development and not yet functional. `README.md` will be updated accordingly when the application is production-ready.

# Running
A live version of this app is running on <a>https://markng.me/KirchhoffsLawApp</a>.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository yourself and run the app using these steps: <br>
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CAG2Mark/KirchhoffsLawApp
cd KirchhoffsLawApp
index.html
```

# Contributing
Currently, the application is open source, so feel free to fork the project for your own needs.

However, I am currently rejecting all pull requests as my ITGS IA is still in progress, and accepting any external help will violate my academic integrity.
